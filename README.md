## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers an old object buried on the land (a tool, a letter, a child's toy) that changes their understanding of its history.
- Draft a community meeting where a proposal for 'efficiency' or 'renewal' divides neighbors who have known each other for generations.
- Create a monologue from Morag's perspective, detailing the unaccounted, invisible labor that holds the farm—and the family—together.
- Imagine a follow-up chapter set five years after the novel's end, from Eilidh's point of view, describing what has changed and what has endured.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Glen Cùil, tagging locations with audio clips of Finlay's memories or ecological data about the land.
- Create a 'Conflict Simulator' for the central dilemma, where a user adjusts sliders for 'Tradition,' 'Economics,' 'Community,' and 'Environment' to generate different story outcomes.
